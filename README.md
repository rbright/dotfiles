# Dotfiles

This repository contains my personal dotfiles managed with [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/).

## âš¡ Requirements

- [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) for dotfile management
- [Just](https://just.systems/) command runner for installation

## ðŸš€ Installation

To install all dotfiles, use the following command from the repository root:

```bash
just install
```

This runs `stow */` which creates symlinks for all configuration directories to your home directory.
